    Analysis
  This code comprises two classes: Main and GameUser. 
  The Main class initializes two instances of the GameUser class, each representing a game user with a name, health, and level. 
  These instances, referred to as one and two, undergo simulated actions. 
  For one, it deducts 10 health points through the takeDamage method and prints the damage taken. 
  For two, it boosts the health by 20 using the heal method and then displays the health of both one and two instances.
  The GameUser class defines attributes for level, username, and health, along with methods to retrieve health (getHealth), to reduce health (takeDamage), and to increase health (heal).
  In essence, the code showcases the interaction between instances of the GameUser class, illustrating basic concepts of object-oriented programming like encapsulation and method invocation.
